I've now learnt how to make web pages in HTML. I've learnt about the several pitfalls in HTML, like a missing end tag or bracket.

The course so far has been pretty easy, overall.

I've not yet found anything difficult.

The various strategies which had been shared, were very useful. They allowed me to write cleaner code as well as to put emphasis on using the right tag for the job.
